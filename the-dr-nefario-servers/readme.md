# The Dr. Nefario setup servers
(Why?. Because I love that scene in `Despicable me` where `Dr. Nefario` packs all his stuff in one little suitcase and leaves)
So, what we have here are the maria.db and php server files. These are kept as minimum as possible for a dev environment.

As a rule this will be cloned into the Dr. Nefario setup. See this [readme](https://github.com/peterbarraud/the-dr-nefario-setup/blob/main/readme.md) for more.
